### Class Documentation Example
```markdown
# UserService

`com.example.service.UserService`

Manages user-related operations including authentication, profile management, and user preferences.

## Overview
This service encapsulates the business logic for user management, providing a clean API for 
user creation, retrieval, update, and deletion operations. It ensures proper validation and 
security checks before performing any operation.

## Dependencies
- `UserRepository` - For data persistence
- `SecurityService` - For authentication and authorization
- `NotificationService` - For sending user notifications

## Public Methods
- [createUser](#createuser)
- [getUser](#getuser)
- [updateUser](#updateuser)
- [deleteUser](#deleteuser)

---

### createUser

```java
public User createUser(UserCreateRequest request) throws ValidationException, DuplicateUserException
```

Creates a new user account in the system.

**Parameters:**
- `request` (UserCreateRequest): Contains user details including:
  - username (required): Unique identifier for the user
  - email (required): Valid email address
  - password (required): Must meet security requirements
  - profileData (optional): Additional user information

**Returns:**
- `User`: The newly created user entity with generated ID

**Exceptions:**
- `ValidationException`: If the request contains invalid data
- `DuplicateUserException`: If a user with the same username or email already exists

**Example:**
```java
UserCreateRequest request = new UserCreateRequest();
request.setUsername("johndoe");
request.setEmail("john.doe@example.com");
request.setPassword("secure_password_123");

try {
    User newUser = userService.createUser(request);
    System.out.println("Created user with ID: " + newUser.getId());
} catch (ValidationException e) {
    System.err.println("Invalid user data: " + e.getMessage());
} catch (DuplicateUserException e) {
    System.err.println("User already exists: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
```

### Advanced Features (Optional)
Consider adding instructions for the agent to generate:

1. A search capability within documentation
2. Version compatibility information
3. Performance considerations for methods
4. Security implications for certain operations
5. Interactive examples (if documentation supports it)

## Implementation Hints
The agent should:

1. First catalog all classes, interfaces, and packages
2. Identify public APIs vs internal implementation details  
3. Detect relationships between classes and components
4. Prioritize documentation of core functionality first
5. Create an accurate dependency graph
6. Generate navigable cross-references between related components

## Evaluation Criteria
The generated documentation will be evaluated on:

1. Technical accuracy
2. Completeness
3. Clarity and readability
4. Organization and navigation
5. Consistency with Oracle Java Documentation standards

## Final Notes
- The documentation should be directly usable by developers of all skill levels
- Content should be suitable for immediate commit into a project repository
- The tone should be professional, concise, and technically precise

## Reasoning Process Example

When analyzing complex code, follow this reasoning process:

**Example Analysis of ComplexDataProcessor.java:**

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - This class implements `DataProcessor` interface and extends `AbstractProcessor`
   - It's part of the data processing pipeline based on package structure
   - It has 12 public methods, 5 protected methods
   - Uses several design patterns: Factory, Strategy, and Observer

2. **Key Responsibilities Identification:**
   - Primary purpose: Transforms raw data into structured outputs
   - Handles error cases with custom exception hierarchy
   - Provides hooks for extension through protected methods
   - Uses callback mechanism for asynchronous processing

3. **Relationship Analysis:**
   - Depends on: `DataSource`, `ConfigManager`, `EventBus`
   - Used by: `ProcessorFactory`, `DataPipeline`
   - Implements: `DataProcessor` interface with specialized behavior

4. **API Surface Documentation Priority:**
   - Most important public methods: `process()`, `configure()`, `addListener()`
   - Complex methods needing detailed explanation: `transformData()`, `applyRules()`
   - Critical parameters: `processingConfig` (impacts entire processing pipeline)

This demonstrates how to think through both the technical details and the conceptual importance of different elements when creating documentation.

## Quality Assurance Process

Before finalizing any documentation, implement this verification process:

1. **Code Understanding Verification**
   - Question: "Have I correctly understood the primary purpose of this code?"
   - Action: Review class/method names, comments, and overall structure again
   - Validation: Ensure documentation aligns with apparent design intent

2. **Documentation Completeness Check**
   - Question: "Have I documented all critical elements?"
   - Action: Check for undocumented public methods, parameters, or return values
   - Validation: Every public API element should have corresponding documentation

3. **Technical Accuracy Review**
   - Question: "Is my explanation technically precise?"
   - Action: Verify parameter types, exception conditions, and method behaviors 
   - Validation: Documentation must match actual code behavior, not assumptions

4. **Value Assessment**
   - Question: "Does this documentation help developers use the code correctly?"
   - Action: Review from perspective of new developers unfamiliar with the codebase
   - Validation: Documentation should answer likely developer questions

5. **Style Consistency Check**
   - Question: "Does this documentation maintain consistent style and tone?"
   - Action: Check for formatting consistency, terminology usage, and voice
   - Validation: Documentation should appear to be written by a single author

## Iterative Documentation Refinement

Apply a multi-pass approach to documentation generation:

1. **First Pass: Structure and Coverage**
   - Generate basic documentation structure for all elements
   - Ensure all public APIs are included
   - Identify gaps in understanding that require deeper analysis

2. **Second Pass: Enrichment**
   - Add detailed descriptions to all elements
   - Incorporate code examples for complex operations
   - Connect related components with cross-references
   - Explain design patterns and architectural decisions

3. **Third Pass: User Perspective**
   - Review from a new developer's perspective
   - Add explanations for non-obvious behaviors
   - Enhance examples to cover common use cases
   - Improve navigation between related components

4. **Final Pass: Polish and Refinement**
   - Ensure consistent terminology and formatting
   - Verify technical accuracy of all descriptions
   - Remove redundancy and improve conciseness
   - Verify hyperlinks and cross-references

## Context Management for Large Codebases

When processing large Java repositories, use these strategies to manage complexity:

1. **Hierarchical Analysis**
   - Begin with package-level analysis to understand overall structure
   - Process top-level public interfaces first to identify the public API surface
   - Then process concrete implementations in logical groups
   - Finally, analyze internal and utility classes

2. **Chunking Strategy**
   - For large classes (>500 lines), process them in logical segments:
     - First: Class declaration, fields, constructors
     - Second: Primary public methods that define core functionality
     - Third: Secondary public methods and protected extension points
     - Fourth: Private helper methods and internal logic

3. **Memory Management**
   - Maintain a summary representation of analyzed classes
   - Track relationships between components in a compact format
   - Prioritize retaining information about public APIs and interfaces
   - For implementation details, focus on patterns rather than exhaustive details

4. **Progressive Refinement**
   - First document the "what" (purpose and behavior)
   - Then add the "how" (implementation approach)
   - Finally add the "why" (design decisions and rationale)

## Edge Case Handling

When documenting complex Java codebases, address these challenging scenarios:

1. **Generic Type Parameters**
   - Explicitly document type parameter constraints and usage
   - Explain the purpose of each type parameter (e.g., `<T extends Comparable<T>>`)
   - Include examples with concrete types for clarity

2. **Functional Interfaces & Lambda Expressions**
   - Document the contract that lambda implementations must fulfill
   - Explain the context in which lambdas are used
   - Provide examples showing both lambda and method reference usage

3. **Annotation Processing**
   - Document the effect of annotations on runtime behavior
   - Explain when annotations are processed (compile-time vs runtime)
   - Describe any generated code or side effects

4. **Reflection & Dynamic Features**
   - Document reflection-based APIs with special attention to runtime performance
   - Explain security implications and permission requirements
   - Provide alternatives to reflection when appropriate

5. **Threading & Concurrency**
   - Document thread-safety guarantees for each class/method
   - Specify synchronization requirements for callers
   - Highlight potential deadlock scenarios or race conditions

6. **Undocumented Legacy Code**
   - When source lacks comments, infer intent from naming and implementation
   - Acknowledge uncertainty where appropriate ("This appears to...")
   - Document observed behavior rather than speculating on design intent

## Documentation Strategy Decision Tree

Select the appropriate documentation approach based on these code characteristics:

1. **API Maturity Assessment**
   - If **stable public API** → Focus on comprehensive interface documentation with guarantees about backward compatibility
   - If **evolving API** → Document current behavior but note which aspects may change
   - If **experimental API** → Clearly mark as experimental and subject to change

2. **Code Complexity Evaluation**
   - If **algorithmically complex** → Include detailed explanations of algorithms with time/space complexity
   - If **architecturally complex** → Document design patterns and component interactions
   - If **simple implementation** → Focus on usage examples rather than implementation details

3. **Usage Pattern Analysis**
   - If **frequently extended** (abstract classes) → Document extension points and override guidelines
   - If **frequently consumed** (utilities) → Prioritize comprehensive usage examples
   - If **infrastructure code** → Document configuration options and operational characteristics

4. **Technical Debt Assessment**
   - If **clean, well-structured code** → Document as designed
   - If **significant technical debt** → Document current behavior while noting improvement opportunities
   - If **legacy compatibility code** → Document historical context and reason for existence

## Code Comprehension Question Framework

When analyzing complex or ambiguous code patterns, use these self-directed questions:

1. **Architectural Intent Questions**
   - "What problem is this code trying to solve?"
   - "Why was this design pattern chosen over alternatives?"
   - "What constraints influenced this implementation approach?"
   - "How does this fit into the larger system architecture?"

2. **API Contract Questions**
   - "What guarantees does this method make to callers?"
   - "What are the implicit assumptions about input parameters?"
   - "What state changes occur during method execution?"
   - "What are the performance characteristics and complexity?"

3. **Error Handling Questions**
   - "What error conditions are explicitly handled?"
   - "What unexpected exceptions might be thrown?"
   - "How are invalid inputs detected and managed?"
   - "What recovery mechanisms exist for failure scenarios?"

4. **Extension Point Questions**
   - "How was this code designed to be extended?"
   - "Which methods are intended to be overridden?"
   - "What contracts must subclasses fulfill?"
   - "What extension scenarios were anticipated by the author?"
