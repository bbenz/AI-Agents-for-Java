## Installation and Setup

### How do I clone the repository?
To clone the repository, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbenz/azure-javaweb-app.git
```

### What are the prerequisites for running the project?
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Apache Maven
- Azure CLI (for deployment)

### How do I build the project?
Navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### How do I deploy the application to Azure?
1. Log in to Azure using the CLI:
    ```bash
    az login
    ```
2. Deploy the application:
    ```bash
    mvn azure-webapp:deploy
    ```

## Usage Questions

### How do I start the application locally?
Run the following command:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### How do I configure the database connection?
Update the `application.properties` file with your database credentials:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<hostname>:<port>/<database>
spring.datasource.username=<username>
spring.datasource.password=<password>
```

### How do I add a new feature to the application?
1. Create a new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
    ```
2. Implement your feature.
3. Commit and push your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add <feature-name>"
    git push origin feature/<feature-name>
    ```

## Troubleshooting Common Errors and Exceptions

### `NullPointerException`
**Cause:** This exception occurs when trying to use an object reference that has not been initialized.

**Solution:** Ensure all objects are properly initialized before use. Example:
```java
String str = null;
if (str != null) {
    System.out.println(str.length());
}
```

### `SQLException`
**Cause:** This exception is thrown when there is an issue with database access.

**Solution:** Check your database connection parameters and ensure the database server is running. Example:
```java
try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)) {
    // Use the connection
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### `FileNotFoundException`
**Cause:** This exception occurs when attempting to open a file that does not exist.

**Solution:** Verify the file path and ensure the file exists. Example:
```java
try {
    File file = new File("path/to/file.txt");
    FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### `IllegalArgumentException`
**Cause:** This exception is thrown when a method receives an argument that is inappropriate.

**Solution:** Validate method arguments before passing them. Example:
```java
public void setAge(int age) {
    if (age < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative");
    }
    this.age = age;
}
```

## Performance Tips

### Optimize Database Queries
Ensure your SQL queries are optimized and use indexes where appropriate to improve performance.

### Use Caching
Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the database and improve response times.

### Profile Your Application
Use profiling tools to identify and address performance bottlenecks in your application.

### Asynchronous Processing
Use asynchronous processing for tasks that do not require immediate results to improve overall application responsiveness.
