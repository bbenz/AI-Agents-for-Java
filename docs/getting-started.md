# Getting Started with Azure Java Web App

Welcome to the Azure Java Web App project! This guide will help you get started with the `bbbenz/azure-javaweb-app` repository, focusing on the `com.microsoft.azure.samples.IndexController` class. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will provide you with the necessary steps to set up, configure, and use the project effectively.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven
- Git

### Cloning the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbenz/azure-javaweb-app.git
cd azure-javaweb-app
```

### Building the Project

Use Maven to build the project:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Running the Application

Once the project is built, you can run the application using:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application should now be running locally. You can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## Common Use Cases

### Displaying the Index Page

The `IndexController` class is responsible for handling requests to the index page. Here is a simple example of how to use it:

```java
package com.microsoft.azure.samples;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller
@RequestMapping("/")
public class IndexController {

    @GetMapping
    public String index() {
        return "index";
    }
}
```

### Handling Form Submissions

To handle form submissions, you can add a method to the `IndexController` class:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;

@Controller
@RequestMapping("/")
public class IndexController {

    @PostMapping("/submit")
    public String handleSubmit(@RequestParam("name") String name) {
        // Process the form data
        return "result";
    }
}
```

### Error Handling

To handle common errors, you can add exception handling methods to your controller:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;

@Controller
@RequestMapping("/")
public class IndexController {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ModelAndView handleError(Exception ex) {
        ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("error");
        modelAndView.addObject("message", ex.getMessage());
        return modelAndView;
    }
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Application Properties

You can configure various aspects of the application using the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory. Here are some common configurations:

```properties
server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=secret
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure the application using environment variables. This is particularly useful for sensitive information like database credentials:

```bash
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=secret
```

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

- Keep your controllers focused on handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Use services to encapsulate business logic.
- Use repositories for data access.

### Security

- Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- Store sensitive information like passwords and API keys securely.

### Performance

- Use caching to improve performance.
- Optimize database queries to reduce load times.
- Monitor and profile your application to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

## Conclusion

This guide has provided you with the essential steps to get started with the `bbbenz/azure-javaweb-app` project. By following the examples and best practices outlined here, you should be able to set up, configure, and use the application effectively. Happy coding!
