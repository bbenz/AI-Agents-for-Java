## Overview

The `azure-javaweb-app` project is a minimalistic Java web application that showcases the integration and deployment of a Java-based web service on Microsoft Azure. The primary functionality is managed by the `IndexController` class, which handles HTTP requests and responses, providing a basic web interface.

## Features

- **Simple Web Interface**: A basic web page served by the `IndexController`.
- **Azure Deployment**: Demonstrates how to deploy a Java web application to Microsoft Azure.
- **HTTP Request Handling**: Basic handling of HTTP GET requests.
